The Touchdown Adventure of the Philae Lander
Weekly Log

Week 2/22/2015 - 2/28/2015

Dominic Balassone - This week I created the HUD for our game. It displays
                    the name of the level, as well as the velocity of the
                    lander to the player. If the velocity is too high for 
                    a successful landing, a warning will be displayed. Once
                    the lander is again at a safe landing velocity, the 
                    warning will disappear.
                    
                    I also started on my own level that will be included
                    in the final game. I am working on the "Return to
                    Earth" level, the final level of the game. Among other
                    things, I have increased the canvas size for that level,
                    as well as worked on trying to get obsticles to orbit
                    the planet. By next week, this should be complete.
                    
Keep up the good work guys!
